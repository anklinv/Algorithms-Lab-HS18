# Algorithms Lab HS18
Solutions to the programming exercises of the Algorithms Lab (AlgoLab) course at ETH in the autumn semester 2018. This is not nicely written code, but rather what I hacked together to solve the exercises.

Most of the solutions are my own, a few exceptions were inspired by community solutions. If you are taking this course, this might be useful to avoid frustration after being unable to solve an exercise for several hours. Use at your own risk.

I also created a table with my thoughts on the exercises when reviewing in the exam period. These are the two PDFs with "insights" in their name. This contains lots of spoilers, so be careful.
